# Terraform
Terraform Basics &amp; Workflow Exploration

As exposed above, the purpose of this repo is mainly about to get an overview of Terraform.
Teherefore, this tool is assumed to be installed on your machine.

For such a goal to be achieved we goona try to deploy a blob container, a web application and finally a virtual machine.

Nota:
